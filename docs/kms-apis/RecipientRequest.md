# RecipientRequest

Specifies that the data is intented for a particular Recipient and must be re-encrypted using the specified public 
key before being sent back.

```json
{
	"AttestationDocument": "Base64EncodedContent",
	"KeyEncryptionAlgorithm": "RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256"
}
```

## AttestationDocument

`AttestationDocument` is generated by the NitroSecureModule of an [AWS Nitro
Enclave](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/), as part of the [Cryptographic Attestation
capability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/set-up-attestation.html).

If the AWS KMS key policy contains [AWS Nitro Enclaves specific key
policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/policy-conditions.html#conditions-nitro-enclaves), the
attestation document will be read and validated (signature and format) and the PCRs contained will be compared to
those in the policy.

When used in the context of a `RecipientRequest`, the `AttestationDocument` must include a RSA2048 key encoded as a
DER SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure ([RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.7)). The public key
included will be used to re-encrypt the data and the result will be placed in the `CiphertextForRecipient` field
instead of the `Plaintext` field.

Type: Base64-encoded binary data object

Required: Yes


## KeyEncryptionAlgorithm

Specifies what algorithm is used to re-encrypt the data decrypted.

Valid values: `RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256`

Type: String

Required: Yes
